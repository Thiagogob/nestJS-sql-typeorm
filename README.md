# :computer: NestJS TypeORM CRUD API

## :link: Project Status

This is a backend-only API project. It currently does not have a public link, but you can run it locally by following the **Getting Started** instructions below.

## :scroll: About

This project is a RESTful API built with **NestJS**, **TypeORM**, and **MySQL**. It provides a basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** interface for managing `Users`, `Profiles`, and `Posts`.

To make the project more robust and demonstrate advanced backend development skills, the following features have been implemented:

  * **Secure Seeding Script**: A repeatable script using **Faker** to populate the database with realistic test data for development and demonstration purposes. (done)
  * **Data Validation**: Ensures that all incoming data is valid before processing, preventing common errors and improving data integrity. (yet to be done)
  * **Efficient Deletion**: Utilizes TypeORM's query builder for secure and efficient `DELETE` operations on a large scale. (yet to be done)

This project is part of a personal portfolio to showcase my backend development capabilities.

## :gear: Technologies

  - **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
  - **[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)**: An ORM that runs on Node.js and can be used with various databases, providing an easy way to interact with the database using TypeScript.
  - **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)**: A powerful and widely-used relational database management system.
  - **[Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/)**: A library for generating massive amounts of fake data.

## :rocket: Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (LTS version recommended)
  * Yarn
  * A running MySQL database instance

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  Configure your database connection in `ormconfig.ts` or `.env` file.
4.  Run the seeding script to populate your database with initial data:
    ```bash
    yarn seed
    ```
5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn start:dev
    ```

The API will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can use a tool like **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test the endpoints.
